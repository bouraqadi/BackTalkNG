# BackTalkNG

Library for constraint programming in Pharo. Initially published on [SqeuakSource](http://www.squeaksource.com/BackTalk/).

An earlier version of this project was initially started with Guillaume Grondin as a port of a library that integrates constraints within Smalltalk. The original version was designed and implemented by Pierre Roy and François Pachet at LIP6 (http://www.lip6.fr/). See their JOOP 1996 paper entitled: "Reifying Constraint Satisfaction in Smalltalk" http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/1997/roy-97b.pdf
